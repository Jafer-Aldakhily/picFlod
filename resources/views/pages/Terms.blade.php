Promotions will in many cases be made available to you via alpha numeric codes (“Promo Codes”).

</div><div>As part of your User account, Careem may provide you with access to features in the Careem application which may allow you to: (i) manage payment for Services; (ii) add and store pre-paid credit balance (“Careem Credit”); (iii) transfer Careem Credit to or receive Careem Credit from other Users, against payment of any applicable Careem Fees and subject to any limits on the number of transfers or the amount of Careem Credit you can send and/or receive, which Fees and limits may be modified by Careem from time to time; and/or (iv) transfer cash to another User (“Cash Transfers”). Cash Transfers are subject to applicable law at all times, may not be permitted in some jurisdictions and, even where permitted and available, are restricted to Cash Transfers to other Users that are resident in the same jurisdiction as you, and that hold a bank account in that same jurisdiction (“Recipient Users”)..
</div><div>
</div><div>When transferring Careem Credit balance to another User, the amount transferred and the applicable Careem Fees (if any) will be deducted from your User account balance and will be transferred to the other User. Once the request for the transfer of Careem Credit is completed, the transfer cannot be cancelled or otherwise reversed. You agree that in providing you with this feature, Careem is merely enabling the transfer of Careem Credit balance and is no way responsible for the actions of the individual Users, including the reason for which Careem Credit is transferred by or to you.

</div><div>
</div><div>Additional restrictions on Careem Bundles, Careem Credits, Trip Discounts and Service Discounts may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or specific terms.

</div><div>From time to time, Careem may offer you incentives to refer new Users to the Careem community (the “Referral Program”). These incentives may come in the form of Careem Credits, Trip Discounts and/or Service Discounts, and Careem may set or change the incentive types, amounts, terms, restrictions, and qualification requirements for any incentives in its sole discretion.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cash transfers by you to Recipient Users are subject to applicable law and limits in respect of the number, frequency and amounts of relevant transfers as well as the location of Recipient Users. Such limits are at the sole discretion of Careem and Careem may modify such limits from time to time without amending this Agreement. Cash Transfers may not be permitted or available in your jurisdiction.
</div><div>
</div><div>Upon receiving a request in relation to a permissible Cash Transfer from you as transferor to a Recipient User as a transferee, Careem shall facilitate such transfer as a facilitator of social payments. The amount you elect to transfer will be deducted from your card on file by Careem subject to any charges incurred by your card issuing bank. The Recipient User you have identified will have the option, once notification of the transfer has been received by the Recipient User, to either receive the Cash Transfer as cash in a permissible bank account held in the name of the Recipient User or to receive Careem Credit in lieu of such cash amount.
</div><div>
</div><div>If you are a Recipient User and elect to receive the Cash Transfer as cash in a permissible bank account held by you, you will be prompted to include the name of your bank, the name on your bank account and the IBAN number only. Careem will then facilitate the transfer of the relevant amount to such permissible bank account held by you. Careem will not ask for you to provide any financially sensitive information. You must only add the IBAN of your own, personal account. You must not add the details of a business account or an account of a third party. If, as a Recipient User, you do not accept the transferred amount within a certain number of days of receipt (and such number of days may vary from time to time), the relevant cash amount will be returned to the account of the transferor.
</div><div>
</div><div>We will hold the amount corresponding with the Credit Transfer for as short a time as possible for the sole purpose of facilitating the Cash Transfer. We endeavor to credit the bank account of the Recipient User as soon as practically achievable after we receive the amount corresponding with the Credit Transfer. We are not responsible for the time it takes the bank of the Recipient User to credit the amount of the Cash Transfer your bank account and Careem shall not be liable in any way for the same and we reserve the right to decline any instruction to effect a Credit Transfer or when accepted, to complete a Credit Transfer.
</div><div>
</div><div>You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you add or include on the Careem app. We may ask you for specific additional information that we believe to be necessary to give effect to our services to you. The provision of false or incomplete information or not providing information when asked may lead to the termination of your Careem profile and prosecution. All activities on the Careem app (including activities in connection with Credit Transfers) are regarded as activities by you and no other Users or persons and you shall not transact in connection with Credit Transfers for or on behalf of any other person.
</div><div>
</div><div>You agree that, in relation to the above-mentioned cash transfer feature, Careem is acting only as a facilitator of social payments, is not responsible or liable for the actions of individual Users (including the reasons for the Cash Transfer) and that Careem does not operate a deposit-taking business in any manner nor is it otherwise presently licensed as a financial institution.
</div><div>
</div><div>Loyalty Programme
</div><div>
</div><div>By becoming a User you are part of the Careem Loyalty Program (the “Program”) in those markets where the Program is available. Users will accrue points through using the services provided by Careem and may have access to a number of services, ways to support their local community, and benefits (“Rewards”) depending upon a given tier status (and relevant availability in any given market).
</div><div>
</div><div>Users can earn or maintain tier status based on their usage of such services in any calendar month. Once a User attains a tier level, it will remain in effect for 2 consecutive months. With respect to the expiry of points earned pursuant to the Program, each calendar year consists of 2 reward periods: from January 1st to June 30th and from July 1st to December 31st (each a “Reward Period”) and any points earned in one Reward Period will expire automatically at the end of the following Reward Period.
</div><div>
</div><div>Rewards are offered at the sole discretion of Careem and may be varied from time to time. Rewards and participating partners may differ from market to market and may be added or removed at the sole discretion of Careem. You may redeem points in exchange for Rewards or Donations (as applicable) at any time as indicated on the App. Where you redeem points Careem shall settle the equivalent or agreed amount (if applicable) with the participating partner and cancel its liability to you for the same. By redeeming Rewards you confirm that you agree to the terms of the Program.
</div><div>
</div><div>Careem has the right to add, change, limit, modify or cancel Program rules, regulations, rules for earning and redeeming Rewards points, rewards, reward levels, redemption levels, processes, benefits, tier statuses, and Program partners without notice, even though such changes may affect the member’s tier status, the value of points already accumulated, the ability to use accumulated points, or the ability to obtain certain rewards.
</div><div>
</div><div>Careem may, among other things: (1) increase or decrease the number of points received for a given action or amount spent or the number of points required for a reward; (2) withdraw, limit, modify, or cancel any reward; (3) add blackout dates, limit availability for any reward, or otherwise restrict the continued availability of rewards; (4) change program benefits served by Rewards or its partners, conditions of participation, rules for earning, redeeming, retaining, or forfeiting points, or rules governing the use of rewards; (5) change or cancel rewards; and (6) change the rules governing the tier statuses, including but not limited to: rules to reach a tier status, duration and expiry rules of the tier status, benefits granted by reaching a given tier status.
</div><div>
</div><div>Careem makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied, and expressly disclaim all liability (including consequential damages) with respect to type, timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided through the Program.
</div><div>
</div><div>If any participating Rewards partner improperly denies a User an accrual or benefit, the liability of Careem shall be limited to the equivalent value, in Rewards points, of that accrual or benefit as determined solely by Careem.
</div><div>
</div><div>The Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until such time as Careem decides to terminate the Program, at any time, with or without notice. If the Program is terminated, all unredeemed points or tier status benefits shall be forfeited without any obligation or liability, no award claims or tier status benefits shall be honoured after the conclusion of any notice period.
</div><div>
</div><div>Careem reserves the right to cancel a User’s access to the Program and revoke any and all unredeemed Careem Rewards points collected by any Member who appears to be using the Program in a manner inconsistent with the terms or intent of the Program or any portion thereof. For reasons that include, but are not limited to: 1) violation of these terms and conditions; 2) misrepresentation of any information or any misuse of this Program; 3) violation of any national, state or local law or regulation in connection with the use of this Program; 4) commission of fraud or abuse involving any portion of this Program; or 5) action, in any other way, to the detriment of the Program or any of its stakeholders; all as may be determined by Careem in its sole discretion.
</div><div>
</div><div>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Program violations, fraud or abuse in relation to rewards points and credit, tier status or reward usage is subject to appropriate administrative and/or legal action by appropriate governmental authorities and/or by Careem including, without limitation, the forfeiture of all point transfers, rewards, tier status or award issued pursuant to point redemptions and any accrued points in your account, as well as cancellation of the account.
</div><div>
</div><div>The earning and redeeming of Rewards points are subject to all applicable local laws and regulations and are offered in good faith, however they may not be available or are subject to change if prohibited or restricted by applicable law or regulation.
</div><div>
</div><div>Separate terms and conditions may apply to your reservation, purchase of goods and services, or rewards that you select. Please read these separate terms and conditions carefully. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in your being denied access to the applicable product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such product or service.
</div><div>
</div><div>Community Support
</div><div>
</div><div>As part of Careem’s support to our communities and the Captains operating on our Platform Careem may make new features available which allow you to direct Careem to support our communities in various ways. These features may be changed and updated from time to time; may not be available in all areas or markets; and those that are available at any given time may be subject to change and/or removal. Careem reserves the right to cancel, suspend or modify these features at any time without notice, for any reason in its sole discretion, and without a liability.

</div><div>To offer these features Careem has partnered with appropriate entities including Government entities, NGOs and charitable organisations (“Participating Organisation”). Please note that Careem is not registered as a charitable organisation and does not hold itself out as such. Careem is not a professional or commercial fundraiser, or a conductor or paid collector of fundraising appeals (or similar), or a guarantor of donations. The management and allocation of support to a Participating Organisation is managed by the Participating Organisation as shown on the App.
</div><div>
</div><div>You can ask Careem to support the cause of a Participating Organisation either by your agreement to burn Reward points pursuant to the Program or to burn Careem credits from your Careem wallet. Upon Careem receiving such agreement from you either to burn Careem credits or Rewards points, Careem will cancel its liability towards you with respect to such Careem credits and/or Rewards points and separately on its own behalf support the relevant Participating Organisation by transferring an amount equal to the nominal value of such Careem credits and/or Rewards points (minus any required fees) to the relevant Participating Organisation. Careem will make such transfer unless it becomes impossible or impracticable to do so. The burning of Careem credits and/or Reward points in the manner described above is irreversible. Careem makes no warranties or representations, either expressed or implied in respect of any of the aforementioned methods of support , and expressly disclaims all liability (including consequential damages) with respect to timeliness, cost, quality or fitness of goods or services provided in relation to the same.
</div><div>
</div><div>If the Participating Organisation that you designated in your listing ceases to be a participating charity or appropriately licensed entity before Careem pays the relevant Participating Organisation or if payment to that entity becomes impracticable, Careem may at its sole discretion choose to make payment to a Participating Organisation having a similar purpose without notifying you.

</div><div>
</div><div>As a User, you agree to pay any amounts charged by Careem (the “Careem Fee”) (if applicable in your jurisdiction) and amounts charged by Captains or other independent third party provider for providing Services to you (“Charges”).
</div><div>
</div><div>After you have received Services from a Captain or other independent third party provider, Careem: (i) may facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Captain as such Captain’s limited payment collection agent and (ii) may collect any applicable Careem Fee directly from you or, in the case of a cash payment, from the relevant Captain. Payment of the Charges and Careem Fee in the above manner shall in all cases be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Captain or other independent third party provider or to Careem, as applicable. Charges and Careem Fees will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law, including any VAT or sales tax. Charges and Careem Fees paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Careem.
</div><div>
</div><div>All Charges and Careem Fees are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Careem using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Careem or a Captain, as applicable, will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Careem may, on its own behalf, and as the Captain’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
</div><div>
</div><div>As between you and Careem, Careem reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Careem Fees at any time in Careem’s sole discretion. Charges may also be varied or revised at any time without your consent. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges and Careem Fees applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Careem will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges and Careem Fees that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges and Careem Fees incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or Careem Fees, as applicable, or the amounts thereof.
</div><div>

</div><div>You shall be responsible for the cost of for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Captain vehicles and property resulting from use of the Careem Platform under your Account in excess of normal “wear and tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”). In the event that a Captain reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Careem in Careem’s reasonable discretion, Careem reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the Captain using any of your payment methods. Such amounts will be transferred by Careem to the applicable Captain and are non-refundable.

</div><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>When entering or participating in a Competition, an Entrant may be eligible for a prize specified in the corresponding promotional material (the “Prize”). Careem may reject an entry at its own discretion, provided that such rejection will not conflict with applicable law.
</div><div>
</div><div>The Prize is non-transferable, non-exchangeable and no cash alternative is offered. In the event of a Prize being unavailable, Careem reserves the right to offer an alternative prize of equal or greater value if circumstances beyond Careem’s control makes it necessary to do so. To the extent permitted by law, the Competition Winner will be responsible for any and all taxes incurred in relation to receipt of the Prize.
</div><div>
</div><div>Participation in a Competition does not automatically mean that the Entrant has won the Prize. A winning entry (the “Competition Winner”) will be chosen by random draw (performed by a computer process or supervised by an independent third party) or by a panel of individuals adjudicating the entries. Reasonable efforts will made to contact the Competition Winner but if the Competition Winner cannot be contacted or fails to reply to Careem’s communication within the communicated timeframe, Careem reserves the right to offer the prize to the next eligible Entrant. Careem will not be liable if the Prize does not reach the Competition Winner for reasons beyond Careem’s reasonable control.
</div><div>
</div><div>Without prejudice to the “Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity” section, neither Careem nor any Affiliates or Partners involved in a Competition will accept responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions, interruptions, deletion, or unauthorized access to Competition entries, or entries lost or delayed whether or not arising as a result of server functions, virus, bugs, or other causes outside Careem’s, an Affiliate’s and/or a Partner’s control. IN NO EVENT SHALL CAREEM’S AND/OR AN AFFILIATE’S AND/OR A PARTNER’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO ANY ENTRANT FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COMPETITION OR ANY MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN RELATION TO A COMPETITION EXCEED THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE PRIZE.
</div><div>
</div><div>Careem reserves the right to cancel or amend the Competition and any associated terms and conditions. Any changes will be notified to the Entrants as soon as reasonably practical. If these terms do not, or do not clearly, cater for a solution to any matter which may arise, then Careem shall have the sole discretion to decide finally on any such matter. Careem’s decisions on any aspect of the Competition is final and binding and no correspondence will be entered into about it.
</div><div>
</div><div>8. Dispute Resolution
</div><div>
</div><div>Arbitration.
</div><div>
</div><div>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Careem Platform or Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and any relevant Affiliate in your jurisdiction, or between you and Careem Networks FZ-LLC if no other Affiliate is incorporated in your jurisdiction, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Careem are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the relevant Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

This “Dispute Resolution” section applies to all Disputes (as defined below) between you and Careem and/or any of its Affiliates.
</div><div>
</div><div>Arbitration Process and Rules.
</div><div>
</div><div>Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to the Careem Platform or this Agreement, including those relating to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be in the city in which the applicable Affiliate with which you have a Dispute has its registered office. The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language.

</div><div>
</div><div>9. Other Provisions

No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you, Careem or any Captain as a result of the contract between you and Careem or use of the Careem Platform.
</div><div>
</div><div>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other provisions in this Agreement shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter.</div></div></h4>
