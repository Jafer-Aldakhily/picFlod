Each time you access or use the Services or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this privacy policy.
<div>
</div><div>Scope and Application

</div><div>
</div><div>When you use our Services, we collect personal information (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) (“Personal Information”) and demographic information (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, post code, hometown, gender, username, device information, including the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (for example, your device's IMEI number, the MAC address of the device's wireless network interface, or the mobile phone number used by the device), mobile network information, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you use, time zone setting, device location, IP address, SMS data, transaction information, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information) (“Demographic Information” and, together with Personal Information, “Personal Data”).

</div><div>
</div><div>Information We Collect From Other Sources
</div><div>
</div><div>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with Personal Data we receive from you or collect through our Services. For example:
</div><div>
</div><div>If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Careem account with a payment provider or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
</div><div>If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, we may receive information about you from your employer.
</div><div>When you request on demand services, our Captains may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.
</div><div>If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Captain, we may combine or associate that information with Personal Data we have collected from you in your capacity as a User or rider.

</div><div>
</div><div>Access to Information
</div><div>
</div><div>The Acts give you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Acts.
